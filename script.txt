Meeting Notes:

Sarah: Welcome everyone to our project kickoff meeting. We're here to launch our new customer portal project. The main objective is to create a user-friendly portal that allows customers to manage their accounts, view orders, and access support.

Mike: From a technical perspective, we're looking at a 6-month development timeline. We'll be using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The architecture will be microservices-based for scalability.

Lisa: I've completed the initial user research and have some key findings. Users want a simple, intuitive interface with quick access to their most-used features. I'll be creating wireframes this week and have mockups ready by next Friday.

David: Marketing is excited about this project. We're planning a soft launch in March with a full launch in April. We'll need the portal to be ready for beta testing by February 15th.

Alex: From a QA perspective, we'll need at least 4 weeks for testing before launch. I recommend we start automated testing setup in January.

Key Decisions Made:



Risks and Issues:
- Potential delay if external API integrations take longer than expected
- Resource constraints if team members are pulled to other projects
- User feedback during beta testing might require significant changes

Budget Considerations:
- Development tools and licenses: $5,000
- Cloud hosting for beta testing: $2,000/month
- Marketing materials: $3,000
- Total estimated budget: $20,000

Next Meeting:
- Weekly standup every Tuesday at 10 AM
- Next milestone review: December 15th
- Design review meeting: December 13th at 2 PM

Meeting concluded at 3:25 PM.
